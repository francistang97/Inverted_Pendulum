# Inverted_Pendulum

This is an 20% assignment for Artificial Intelligence course at Massey University. Your task is mainly to design and implement a fuzzy controller (Zero-order Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System) for balancing an inverted pendulum system.  

Here's the info from Dr N.H.Reyes:
"A start-up program using second-order derivative physics equations and the emulated BGI graphics library are provided, simulating the complete dynamics of the cart-pendulum system.  In addition, it also includes a function for collecting data points for plotting a control surface, and a fuzzy logic engine that you can utilise to implement a complete fuzzy controller."
